# EleBull_VISION

**EleBull_VISION** is a Python-based video feed application that leverages [Flet](https://flet.dev/) for building the UI and [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) for real-time object detection. This project is primarily designed to detect and track animals (or people) across multiple camera feeds, each with individually configurable default settings.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Multiple Camera Feeds**: Set up multiple cameras, each with unique, configurable settings.
- **YOLO Object Detection**: Use YOLO for real-time animal/person detection and tracking, with unique ID assignment for each detected entity.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive, Flet-based UI for easy configuration of settings, camera selection, and theme.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from YOLO models (.pt or .engine files) to suit detection needs.
